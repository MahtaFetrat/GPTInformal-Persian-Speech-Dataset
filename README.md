# GPTInformal-Persian-Speech-Dataset
GPTInformal Persian is a free licensed Persian dataset of audio and text pairs designed for speech synthesis and other speech-related tasks. The dataset has been collected, processed, and annotated as a part of the Mana-TTS project. For details on data processing pipeline and statistics on this dataset, please refer to the paper in the Citation secition.

## Data Source
The text for this dataset was generated using GPT4o, with prompts covering a wide range of subjects such as politics and nature. The texts are intentionally crafted in informal Persian. Below is the prompt format used to generate these texts:

> Please give me a very long text written in informal Persian. I want it to be mostly about [SUBJECT].

These generated texts were then recorded in a quiet environment. The audio and text files underwent forced alignment using [aeneas](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas), resulting in smaller chunks of audio-text pairs as presented in this dataset.
